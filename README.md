## Projects 🌟

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### Research (Predictive Algorithm Framework (PAF)) :
The research focused on how comorbidities, the core health condition and our daily lifestyle activities could affect complex disease treatment.
Associative Data Mining techniques : These were used for finding associations or correlations between the large sets of data items. Item set lattices and “Apriori” were some of the algorithms used to explore the dataset for both risk factor selection and combinations. The “apyori” library in pandas was used for this and based on the results of the algorithm python was then used to create the script of the prediction algorithm.
Probability pooling by weighted averages : This technique was used to aggregate the found probabilities.
Python : Used python to create a script called GCALC for predicting both preventive and permissive probabilities of prostate cancer occurrence based on the discovered insights.


### Bootcamp Project, HyperionDev :
Programming Fundamentals : Learnt the basics of programming languages like Python, essential for all subsequent data analysis tasks.
Statistical Analysis : Learnt the fundamental statistics, including descriptive and inferential statistics, to analyse and interpret data effectively.
Data Manipulation and Cleaning : Acquired skills in data wrangling using libraries like pandas in Python to prepare data for analysis.
Data Visualisation : Learnt to create basic visualisations with tools like matplotlib in Python to communicate data insights visually.
Machine Learning Basics and Version Control: Gained an introductory understanding of machine learning techniques such as linear regression and k-means clustering and version control with GitHub.
